# Social-Network-Dynamic-Analysis 
A comprehensive project leveraging Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques to explore relationships, identify key influencers, detect communities, and predict future connections within a dummy social network
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of a **Social Network Analysis (SNA)** project, which studies the structure, dynamics, and key factors influencing relationships within a dummy social network. The analysis employs various SNA techniques and visualizations to derive insights into the network's behavior and structure.

## 📜 **Introduction**
Social Network Analysis involves studying the relationships between nodes (individuals, groups, organizations, etc.) in a network. This project analyzes a synthetic dataset modeling interactions between individuals, aiming to:

- Understand network dynamics.
- Identify influential individuals.
- Detect communities.
- Explore demographic-based interaction patterns.
- Predict potential future connections.

---

## 🧑‍💻 **Features**
1. **Network Construction:**
   - Nodes: Attributes such as gender, section, and unique identifiers.
   - Edges: Represent relationships between individuals.
   - Tools: NetworkX for graph modeling, Matplotlib for visualization.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Spring and Circular layouts to display network structures.
   - Node and edge attributes to differentiate demographics and centrality.

3. **Centrality Analysis:**
   - Degree, Betweenness, Closeness, and Eigenvector Centrality to identify key individuals in the network.

4. **Community Detection:**
   - Modular community detection for subgroup analysis.

5. **Gender-Based Interaction Analysis:**
   - Homophily trends in Male-Male, Female-Female, and Male-Female relationships.

6. **Link Prediction:**
   - Adamic-Adar index to forecast potential future relationships.

7. **Information Diffusion:**
   - Simulated processes to study how information spreads through the network.

## 🛠️ **Tools and Technologies**
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** NetworkX, Matplotlib, Pandas
- **Graph Techniques:** Centrality measures, Modularity Maximization, Link Prediction
- **Visualization:** Advanced node and edge styling for effective data representation
